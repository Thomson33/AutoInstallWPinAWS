## AWS Preparation

To use this script, you need (obviously) an Amazon AWS account.

Then, you have to create a key pair. Keep it name in mind. You'll need it in to run the program. (How to create a key pair on EC2 : (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html) 

After that, you'll need to create a User and get AWS Access ID and Secret Key.
To do that :

1. Launch the Identity and Access Management console (IAM) in AWS. 

2. Click Users on the navigation menu on the left of the screen. 

3. In the popup window, click on Add User.

4. In the new window, provide a user name and choose the 'Programmatic Access' access type, then click next.

5. To set the permissions, choose 'Attach Existing Policies Directly' and in the Policy Filter type 'AmazonEC2FullAccess', you can choose any permission level, but in this example I'll click on the checkbox next to 'AmazonEC2FullAccess'. Then repeat this step with 'AmazonSNSFullAccess' and then click the 'next' button.

6. Finally, review the user and permission levels, and click on the 'Create User' button. 

7. The next page will show your keys, as shown below. These are only available once, so it its a good idea to download and save then safely in a secure location.
